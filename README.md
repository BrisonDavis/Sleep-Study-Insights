# Sleep Study Insights Dashboard

This project analyzes sleep lab data using Python in an Azure Machine Learning environment. The goal is to extract meaningful insights to help improve lab performance, resource planning, and patient outcomes.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Azure Machine Learning Notebooks
- VS Code (optional)
- GitHub for version control

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning (handling nulls, converting date/time, renaming columns)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Creating visualizations with 'matplotlib'
- Communicating insights clearly

## Insights Included
1. Average duration by disorder type
2. Average duration by technician
3. Study volume by disorder type
4. Average duration by machine used
5. Pass rate by disorder type

## Real World Relevance
This project simulates tasks done by data analysts, data engineers, and ML engineers in healthcare settings. It demonstrates full ownership of a dataset â€” from cleaning to insight delivery.
