# Sleep Study Insights Dashboard

This project analyzes sleep lab data using Python in an Azure Machine Learning environment. The goal is to extract meaningful insights to help improve lab performance, resource planning, and patient outcomes.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Azure Machine Learning Notebooks
- VS Code (optional)
- GitHub for version control

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning (handling nulls, converting date/time, renaming columns)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Creating visualizations with 'matplotlib'
- Communicating insights clearly

##  Dataset Information

This dataset was manually created using realistic values based on actual sleep lab operations. It includes fields such as:

- 'TechName – Technician names  
- 'DisorderType' – Type of disorder being studied  
- 'StartTime' and 'EndTime' – Study duration timestamps  
- 'MachineUsed' – Equipment used for the study  
- 'Passed' – Whether the study met defined success criteria  

The structure and contents are designed to simulate a real-world healthcare environment based on the author’s experience as a registered polysomnographic technologist (RPSGT). This enables the project to reflect practical workflows and challenges encountered in sleep study labs — such as technician performance, study volume by disorder, and machine impact on duration.

## Insights Included
1. Average duration by disorder type
2. Average duration by technician
3. Study volume by disorder type
4. Average duration by machine used
5. Pass rate by disorder type

## Real World Relevance
This project simulates tasks done by data analysts, data engineers, and ML engineers in healthcare settings. It demonstrates full ownership of a dataset — from cleaning to insight delivery.
